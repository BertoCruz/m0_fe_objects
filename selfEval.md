# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

If it had to be one thing, I'd have to say that I struggled to conceptualize the object literal at the beginning in my head. it wasn't until I tied the structure to something  like how the hashtag works. key:value structure. like when you call a hashtag and you get a whole search result. after that it was smooth sailing.


- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

note-taking has been great, I found that I have been writing down more when it comes to the vocabulary, because the actual terminology , and how I communicate my processes, is the most crucial part. other notes I have been writing down have been "best-practices" I take my time to do research on.


- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I find myself that looking up the actual documentation is helpful, because i'm on the side of formalities and best practices. but that's not to say that I don't try to test things out myself. I go straight into testing mode once I have an idea of what the proper way of doing things is.
